Okay, I might need to replace multiState's 2D list with a 2D dictionary to allow hole creation.
I have two open functions working, but I need to create a sort functional
It's a small detail, but I need the app to update when sorting
I need a way to manually view and edit the z-level and times of different states

I should swap the order of the time and z-levels in multiState to make sorting more efficient
