I rewrote much of the code to follow more functional based programming proceedures.
This fixed a few errors, made the code more readable, and more managable, so it will stay.

I'm having a problem where my neighbor filters are removing viable cells, but not updating their
neighbors while doing so. Also, there is not a one-to-one relationship between cells and their
neighbors. I don't like filtering by one-to-one, but I do need to re-afferm that relationship
between filters in order to ensure reliable data. Currently rerunning the neighbor filters a
few times fixes this, but that is not an ideal solution.

I'm about ready to start moving to multiple picture processing.

I could have a filter for deviation of shortest neighbor distances

cell neighbors do not link back got actual CELLS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
