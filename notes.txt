I'm having a problem where my neighbor filters are removing viable cells, but not updating their
neighbors while doing so. Also, there is not a one-to-one relationship between cells and their
neighbors. I don't like filtering by one-to-one, but I do need to re-afferm that relationship
between filters in order to ensure reliable data. Currently rerunning the neighbor filters a
few times fixes this, but that is not an ideal solution.

cell neighbors do not link back got actual CELLS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
GUI and AppCore are seperated. Filters not working as well as they were before.


Okay, I might need to replace multiState's 2D list with a 2D dictionary to allow hole creation.
I have two open functions working, but I need to create a sort functional
It's a small detail, but I need the app to update when sorting
I need a way to manually view and edit the z-level and times of different states
